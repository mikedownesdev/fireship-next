 * server side generated. This means that blog post HTML
 * files will be constructed at BUILD time, giving the
 * user a very fast UX and, because it is server side
 * like SSR, SEO and Linkbot performance is optimized, too.
 * 
 * 
 * To pre-render a page, or implement STATIC GENERATION
 * we use the getStaticProps function which tells Next.js
 * to fetch data here on the server at BUILD time in 
 * order to pre-render this page in advance
 *

 * 
 * We can tell Next.js which paths to render with the
 * getStaticPaths function. 
 * 
 * So here we'll query ALL of the posts in our DB, since
 * we want to SSG+ISR all posts. Then we'll map them down
 * into objects and call them "paths" since the paths indeed
 * are [username]/[slug]
 *

     * getStaticProps function.
     * 
     * Great; Build, Pre-render, Hoorah!
     * 
     * With traditional SSG, Next.js would have no way
     * of knowing when a NEW post (path) was added to the
     * database. So if you tried to load this new post,
     * (www.myapp.com/donaldduck/donnys-new-post), it would
     * not be found and you'd receive a 404 instead!
     * 
     * However, adding a fallback value of "blocking":
     * 
     * When a user tries to access a page that has not been
     * rendered yet, it tells Next.js to "fallback" to SSR.
     * Once it renders the page, then it can be cached on the
     * CDN for the next person, like all the other pages.
     * 
     * That's really awesome, because otherwise you would need
     * to REBUILD(!) your entire site with regular SSG. This
     * would be very inefficient if you have a really big site
     * with lots of content
